#     next thing that we need to do is create an inner
# class an inner class is a class that we can use that will provide just some
# information about this form these are called meta classes and Django
# usually uses them internally to determine things about the class but
# we can also use it to specify the model that we want store information in and we
# want we want to use it to specify the fields that we're going to expose which
# our email, username, password1 and password2
